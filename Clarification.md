### Questions on Tensors
    ❓ **Question:** Why can't tensors store strings?

🧠 **Answer:** Because tensors are optimized for fixed-size numerical types, not variable-length data like strings.

    ❓ **Question:** Define the analogy of vectors in physics vs ML

🧠 **Answer:** Refer this [Answers](DetailedAnswer/AnalogyOfVectorinML.md)
    
    ❓ **Question:** Does numpy ndarray = tensor

🧠 **Answer:** NumPy is not exactly a tensor library, but it's a foundational numerical array library that inspired how tensors are implemented in ML frameworks.
NumPy provides multi-dimensional arrays (ndarray) and basic linear algebra — so yes, it can handle tensor-like data
But NumPy is not designed for:

- Training neural networks

- GPU acceleration

- Auto-differentiation (needed for backpropagation)

Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow offer a more complete tensor abstraction, building on the same core concepts — but with ML-specific tooling.

❓ **Question:** Can I say numpy 2d array or matrix = dataframe in pandas

🧠 **Answer:** You're close — but let's clarify the relationship between a NumPy 2D array, a matrix, and a Pandas DataFrame, because while they are similar, they are not exactly the same.

✅ You can say:

A Pandas DataFrame is built on top of a NumPy 2D array and behaves similarly to a matrix in many ways.

But you shouldn't say:

"NumPy 2D array or matrix = DataFrame"

Because that implies they are equivalent or interchangeable, which is not quite true.

| Concept        | NumPy 2D Array              | NumPy Matrix (deprecated) | Pandas DataFrame                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Data Structure | Homogeneous 2D array        | Homogeneous 2D matrix     | Heterogeneous table (rows + columns) |
| Data Types     | Same type (e.g. all floats) | Same type                 | Can have different types per column  |
| Labels         | No labels (just indices)    | No labels                 | Has row and column labels            |
| Functionality  | Optimized for math          | Matrix math (limited use) | Rich data analysis tools             |
| Library        | NumPy                       | NumPy                     | Pandas                               |

🔁 Conversion is possible:

From NumPy array to DataFrame:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

arr = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
df = pd.DataFrame(arr)
```
From DataFrame to NumPy array:
```python
arr = df.values  # or df.to_numpy()
```
✅ Better ways to say it:

"A DataFrame is like a labeled 2D NumPy array."

"A Pandas DataFrame can be created from a NumPy 2D array."

"They are similar in shape and structure, but a DataFrame is more powerful for labeled data."
